# Risk-Warzone-Game

Worked collaboratively in a team of four developers via Github to develop a C++ program compatible with the rules of the “Warzone” version of Risk, accessible at warzone.com.
Implemented the map feature of the game, where the map is a connected graph of continents and continents are connected subgraphs of territories.
Provided validation methods using depth first search to check if a map is of the desired format.
Designed a MapLoader class with exception handling that processes any .map file.
Implemented the user interaction mechanism to start a game.
Implemented the observer, strategy and adapter design patterns.
